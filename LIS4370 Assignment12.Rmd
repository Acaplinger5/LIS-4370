## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Step 1 Load all libraries
```{r, Step 1}
#Write code Here
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Step 2 Read, Investigate and Clean Data if needed

For now this will be basic investigating and cleaning(not needed for basics below) in final will remove multiple columns and NAs

```{r, Step 2}
#Write code here 
soccer_data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\capli\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\USF\\LIS 4370 R Programming\\Final Project\\SoccerDataset.csv")

str(soccer_data)


```

## Step 3 Write functions for shot accuracy for player and teams

Will add shot accuracy for teams in final

```{r, Step 3}
# Write code here
soccer_data <- soccer_data %>%
  mutate(Shot_Accuracy = (Shots_on_Target / Total_Shots) * 100)
```

## Step 4 Write fucntions for goals per match and conversion rate for player and teams

Will add for teams in final

```{r, Step 4}
# Write code here
soccer_data <- soccer_data %>%
  mutate(
    Goals_per_Match = Goals / Matches_Played,
    Conversion_Rate = (Goals / Shots_on_Target) * 100)
```

## Step 5 Create Visuals for steps 3 and 4 above

Not all visuals listed below, all will be in final 

```{r, Step 4}
# Write code here
ggplot(club_stats, aes(x = reorder(Club, -Shot_Accuracy), y = Shot_Accuracy)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Shot Accuracy per Club", x = "Club", y = "Shot Accuracy (%)")

# Goals per match per player
ggplot(soccer_data, aes(x = reorder(Player, -Goals_per_Match), y = Goals_per_Match)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Goals per Match per Player", x = "Player", y = "Goals per Match")
```
